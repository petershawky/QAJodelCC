# QAJodelCC
*Welcome to QA @ Jodel*

Dear Applicant,

This assessment has two (2) mandatory tasks. If you cannot fulfill task no. 2, please contact us and we will provide an alternative.

First task

Your first task is to create a test strategy for our Jodel app. Consider the scenario where you have very limited QA resources (lack of time, shortage of test devices):

Which are the most important features to test?
How would you define a problematic release and which aspects would you focus on to avoid it?
Create an outline of features you would test, focusing on good coverage rather than a comprehensive list of test cases. Additionally, provide a concise explanation of your prioritization.

What we'll be evaluating

The goal is to demonstrate your ability to approach app testing strategically, rather than to present a comprehensive list of test cases. We want to see how you prioritize and why -- understanding your reasoning is very important for us.

Second task

Your second task is to test the posting function of our mobile app. You can get the app either for Android or for iOS.

Write a list of test cases, with an emphasis on good coverage.
Prioritize these test cases according to their business impact and state your reasons concisely for doing so;
Create a solution for automating these test cases; you can use a language and framework of your choice;
Provide a short explanation for your automation solution, plus some instructions on how we can run it ourselves.
What we'll be evaluating

The goal here is to see how autonomous you are and how much you've made your internal switch to think in "automated mode" rather than "manual testing mode". The choice of technologies is not important for us -- you can choose whatever you feel comfortable with. But we'll be looking in detail into how you design the test cases and how easily we can pick up your work and build on top of it.

Delivery

Fork this repo and once you're done send us a link to your own Github repo with instructions on how to run tests.

Please do not send us a pull request! Instead just send us the link with your solution over email and we'll take it from there.

Talk to us

We're more than happy to give you support and disucss any problem you have along the way. If you have questions don't hesitate in approaching us!
